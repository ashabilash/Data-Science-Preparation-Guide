-- Table: Players

-- +-------------+-------+
-- | Column Name | Type  |
-- +-------------+-------+
-- | player_id   | int   |
-- | group_id    | int   |
-- +-------------+-------+
-- player_id is the primary key of this table.
-- Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.
-- Table: Matches

-- +---------------+---------+
-- | Column Name   | Type    |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- | match_id      | int     |
-- | first_player  | int     |
-- | second_player | int     | 
-- | first_score   | int     |
-- | second_score  | int     |
-- +---------------+---------+
-- match_id is the primary key of this table.
-- Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
-- first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
-- You may assume that, in each match, players belongs to the same group.
 

-- The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group. In the case of a tie, 
-- the lowest player_id wins.

-- Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Players table:
-- +-----------+------------+
-- | player_id | group_id   |
-- +-----------+------------+
-- | 15        | 1          |
